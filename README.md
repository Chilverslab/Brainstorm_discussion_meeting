# Brainstorming/discussion lab meeting

* Journal club for discussion of papers relevant for lab research
* Brainstorm for different topics:
	*  Structure for upcoming paper and figures to be included.
	*  Research: experimentla design, next step, re-think project hypothesis/question.
	*  "Hackaton/Bioinformatics" : work together on demo or solutions for different anlaysis that you are conducting.
	*  Chalk talk: No slides. Present an idea for a future research project. This should include an observation, hypothesis, predictions, and discussion of several specific aims.

The idea is to keep this venue open to any suggestions, and try to give feedback to each other on the different projects and keep learning on the latest techniques/software that we could take advantage from.

For now we are thinking on Friday or Tuesday around 3 pm or at 1 pm, whatever you guys prefer and we can have an hour long discussion on any of the suggested topics.

The idea is to rotate on the different options to cover different formats.

Once, we decided on a time for the meeting, I will post an schedule so anyone interested can sign in.  It is not an obligation, but the idea is to get most feedback that you can from your collegues, providing support on draft papers, enagging on discussions, and having a __positive__ influence on each other research.
