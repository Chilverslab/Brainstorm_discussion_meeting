# Brainstorm discussion - lab meeting

* Brainstorm on different topics on __your project__:
	*  Structure for upcoming paper and think about figures to be included in the paper.
	*  Experimental design, next step on your project, re-think project hypothesis/question.
	*  "Hackathon/Bioinformatics" solutions: work together on demo or solutions for different anlaysis that you are conducting.
	*  Chalk talk: No slides. Present an idea for a future research project, hypothesis, predictions, and discussion of several specific aims.

The idea is to keep this venue open to any suggestions, and try to give feedback to each other on the different projects and keep learning from each other.

For now we are thinking on Friday or Tuesday around noon, 1 pm, or 3 pm, whatever you guys prefer and we can have an hour long discussion on any of the suggested topics.

Once, we decide on a time for the meeting, I will post an schedule so anyone interested can sign in.  It is not an obligation, but the idea is to get most feedback that you can from your collegues, providing support on draft papers, engaging on discussions, and having a __positive and cosntructive__ influence on each other research.
